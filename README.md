3) Explain how you distinguish a symptom vs. a cause when testing.

Often times within the QA process, test cases fail. But why are they failing? This can be tricky. A great QA engineer is able to provide exact reasons to the developer, rather than simply saying a test case “failed”.
```

4) Do you feel comfortable standing up to developers who disagree with your results?

In some situations, reporting failures can be a delicate process. Perhaps a developer spent a lot of time on some code which does not exactly meet specifications. QA engineers need to be able to stand up for what they know is right.
```

5) Are you willing to cut corners to save time?

The correct answer is NO. All test cases need to be run, and making assumptions frequently leads to issues down the road.
```

6) Can you explain the SDLC and Agile methodology?

QA engineers must understand their role and where it fits into the ecosystem.
```

7) Explain your attitude toward documentation. Do you believe more is better? Why or why not?

This is a trick question because more documentation is not always better. In fact, it can be detrimental. Documentation needs to be thorough, but still efficient as possible. If there is too much documentation, important details can be missed.
```

```text
8) How do you go about learning a new product?

This is perhaps the biggest challenge of being a QA engineer. They need to be comfortable and patient with learning complex software. They should be prepared to ask a lot of questions.
```

```text
9) How well do you work with others?

Many QA teams have team members who are from all corners of the world. QA engineers must be comfortable communicating with people of all backgrounds and all levels of language proficiency.
```

```text
10) Do you see yourself as a perfectionist?

Great QA engineers are perfectionists. Their job is to ensure that all of the software they test meets or exceeds quality standards, and sloppy work is only going to lead to trouble further down the line.

11) How well do you work under pressure and with deadlines?

Testing usually comes at the end of the SDLC and testing can be viewed as a bottleneck, so being able to perform under tight deadlines and pressure is important.

Staying up to date on industry news and trends is important in order for you team to keep up with evolving technology and best practices changes.  It also shows how much they like their job!

14) What motivates you?

There are several potential answers to this question. Company culture will play a large part in differentiating a good from bad answer.   For instance, if teamwork is important within the product team, a candidate who is driven by internal competition might not be the best fit.
```

15) What are your ultimate career aspirations?

It is important to learn what your candidate hopes to be in the next year, or 3 years.   If the candidate desires a career path you can’t provide, you might be interviewing again sooner than you’d like.
